# Rick's Arcade Game
### Based on Udacity's Front-End Arcade Game Project
===============================
## Overview
This project is a javascript-focused practice project that attempts to recreate the classic frogger game. The player starts off at the bottom of the game map and must navigate to the top without being hit by any of the enemies. The basic engine and assets for the game were provided. I added the logic that controls the entities in the game and the winning and losing conditions.

## Setup
1. Clone the project to your local filesystem
2. Navigate to the project in your filesystem and decompress it using an archive utility
3. Open the index.html within the project using your web browser
4. Enjoy!

## Usage
Make it to the top without coming into contact with any of the bugs.
* up arrow = up
* left arrow = left
* right arrow = right
* down arrow = down

## Next Steps
* Add stages with different levels of difficulty
* Add items to collect
* Add point system
* Make player image customizable
* Different enemy types

## Bugs/Known Issues
None
